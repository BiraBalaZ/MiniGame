# Mini Game in Python

Before I decided to create a "Mini Game" I started a sample project to understand Classes and Objects.
My friend Renato is teaching and daring me, I understand a lot of concepts creating this 'game' and had a lot of fun in this journey. 
So, I'm trying to turn my English better, because my first language is Portuguese Brazil.
